# yomamajoke
This is a repository to share the code for my [@YoMamaJokeBot](https://twitter.com/YoMamaJokeBot) Twitter bot.

## The plan
I originally thought of the template of a normal Yo Mama joke which would be "Yo mama is so (insult adjective) that she (verbs) (noun)".
There are many words in each list that if worked perfectly would make a coherent yo mama joke but the point is that it won't make sense the vast majority of the time.
The fact that they mostly don't make sense makes it even funnier because it sounds like a little kid trying to make a yo mama joke
and it makes it that much funnier when it makes one that actually makes sense.
